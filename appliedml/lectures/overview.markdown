# What's this course about?

_Gettting from raw data to useful models._

# Administrative

_Computer setup:_ Use whatever programming language you wish. Recommended: python, R.
You are responsible for setting up your programming environment. It may be useful to
use AWS, especially f you wish to experiment with a distributed computation environment
(eg Spark) or GPUs. 

_Format:_ Course time will be a mix of lecture, discussion (usually in small groups),
and hands-on time. Students should be prepared to work at a computer and to
interact. Remote students should make sure they have a working microphone and camera.

_Homework:_ Homework will be mostly projects. You will be expected to download data,
ready it, and build models on it. You will turn-in a report and, for one project, give a short
presentation in class. Some projects may be more development-focused. Additionally,
you must give feedback on the first few lectures: two items, can be negative or positive or
one of each. What works for you? What did you find interesting? What was confusing? What
was awkward? What was unclear?

_Textbook:_
We will not follow a textbook closely, but there will be some readings from the following:

| Abbreviation | Title | Authors | Link|
| -- | -- | -- | -- | 
| ESL | Elements of Statistical Learning, 2nd ed | Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman |[here](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) |
| MMD | Mining of Massive Datsets, 2nd ed | Leskovec, Rajaraman, Ullman | [here](http://www.mmds.org/)|

| TFS | Thinking, Fast and Slow | Kahneman | Not online, but inexpensive |

_Modeling and software packages:_
There are many types of statistical models and many software packages to fit them. This
course is not based on around any one (though linear models, decision trees, and neural
networks will often be used for discussion). I recommend working with whatever interests
you and trying more than one.

# Data science principles

* Always start simple, establish baselines.
* Work iteratively: diagnose a weakness; come up with an improvement; implement it; test it; repeat.
* Organize and automate entire data science pipeline. Avoid one-off attempts to improve model by, e.g., tweaking a hyperparameter.
* More technology != better solution.
* Big data != useful data.
* Careful with overfitting
* Don't fool yourself: confirmation bias, statistical significance.
