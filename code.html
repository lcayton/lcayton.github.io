<h2>Random ball cover (RBC) - GPU</h2>
<p>[<a href="https://github.com/lcayton/RandomBallCover-GPU/archive/master.zip">version
  0.2.6</a>, <a href="readmeRBC.txt">readme</a>], Oct
  2011. (Original release: August 2010)
<p>The RBC is a simple geometric data structure for fast nearest
  neighbor search in metric spaces that is provably sensitive
  to <i>intrinsic</i> dimensionality.  Because of its design, the data
  structure can make use of the power of parallel systems, like
  GPUs. The <a href="rbc-adms-talk.pdf">slides</a> from 
  the ADMS talk provide a simple overview of the data structure; see
  my <a href="papers.html">papers</a> (in particular, <i>Accelerating
  nearest neighbor search on manycore systems</i>) for a more
  complete, rigorous description.  
  
<p>This is a C and CUDA implementation of the RBC.  It builds the data
  structure and finds nearest neighbors on a (nvidia) GPU.
  Modern GPUs provide strong nearest neighbor performance even
  without a data   structure; hence the RBC as implemented here
  improves over a high baseline.  In addition to the basic RBC
  implementation, the code contains fast brute force kernels, and
  supports k-NN search via efficient sorting networks.
  
<p>Version 0.2.6 contains a simplified driver, various cleanups,  and
  a few minor bug fixes.  See the versions file in the archive
  or the <a href="http://github.com/lcayton/RandomBallCover-GPU">git repository</a> for the full development history. 
  

  <p><h2>Random ball cover - multicore CPU</h2>
  <p>[<a href="https://github.com/lcayton/RandomBallCover-CPU/archive/master.zip">version
  0.1.1</a>, <a href="readmeCRBC.txt">readme</a>], June 2011. (Original
  Release: April 2011)
  <p>This is a multicore CPU implementation of the approximate and exact
  nearest neighbor search algorithms based on the RBC.  It has been
  tested on a variety of machines, ranging from a simple dual-core Mac
  laptop to a 48-core AMD server machine.  
    
    <p>The implementation is written in C and parallelized with OpenMP.
    
    <p> Version 0.1.1 is a minor bugfix.

  <h2>Bregman ball tree (bbtree)</h2>
  <p>[<a href="https://github.com/lcayton/bbtree/archive/master.zip">code</a>, <a href="readme.txt">readme</a>], March 2008.  
    <p>The bbtree is a data structure for fast nearest neighbor
    retrieval when <i>nearest</i> is measured not using a metric, but
    with relative entropy (KL-divergence) or another Bregman
    divergence.  See my ICML 2008 paper for more information on this
    data structure.
